# üß† Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction
This project aims to predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not, using machine learning techniques applied to a real-world hotel reservations dataset.


## üéØ Project Objectives

- Analyze the factors that influence booking cancellations (e.g., stay duration, room type, average daily rate, booking lead time, meal plan, customer history, etc.)
- Clean and preprocess the data (handling missing values, handling outliers, encoding categorical features, scaling)
- Build and compare multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Optimize the best model using hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluate performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
- Interpret results and identify the most important variables influencing cancellations
